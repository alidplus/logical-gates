## Goals
to make a dynamic formula generator with contants, arguments and logical gates (and, or, ...)
- **Arguments**: named variables you can define them in global scope to reuse in your formula.
- **Contants**: any boolean value you can set inside your formula.
- **Logical gates**: some predefined functions to use as logical operators inside your formula.

## Gates
- **AND**: The AND gate is a basic digital logic gate that implements logical conjunction (∧) from mathematical logic. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate)
- **OR**: it performs a logical disjunction (∨) from mathematical logic. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OR_gate)
- **XOR**: implements an exclusive or ({\displaystyle \nleftrightarrow }\nleftrightarrow) from mathematical logic. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate)
- **NOT**: which implements logical negation. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverter_(logic_gate))

## Todo
- [ ] NAND gate
- [ ] NOR gate
- [ ] XNOR gate
- [ ] IMPLY gate

## Running localy
1. clone code into your machine
2. install dependancies:
```sh
yarn
```
3. start app in `development` mode
```sh
yarn start
```
